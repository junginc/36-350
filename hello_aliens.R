We speak different languages and havedifferent cultures but we share the planet and live harmoniously. Our planet is comprised of ocean, which is water, and of land. Not only we havehumans living on our planet, but also the wildlife, from animals to insects and plants. People living on Earth cook and eat animals, fish, vegetables as their mainfood to obtain appropriate nutritients. We are part of the Solar System, where we circle around the Sun along with some other planets because of Sun's gravity. If you would like to visit Earth, you are welcomed to do so at anytime. Now could do talk about your planet? Who is living on this planet, how has your planet evolvedover time and how is the culture like on this planet?","\n")
