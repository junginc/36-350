cat("Hello, I am from a planet called Earth. I came to represent Earth and inform you about Earth. \nIt is a beautiful planet that has over 7.5 billion people who are living on it. \nWe speak different languages and havedifferent cultures but we share the planet and live harmoniously. \nOur planet is comprised of ocean, which is water, and of land. Not only we havehumans living on our planet, \nbut also the wildlife, from animals to insects and plants. People living on Earth cook and eat animals, fish, \nvegetables as their mainfood to obtain appropriate nutritients. We are part of the Solar System, where we \ncircle around the Sun along with some other planets because of Sun's gravity. If you would like to \nvisit Earth, you are welcomed to do so at anytime. Now could do talk about your planet? \nWho is living on this planet, how has your planet evolvedover time and how is the culture like on this planet?","\n")
